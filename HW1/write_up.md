# Problem 1
* The number of recorded crimes in 2018 is less than that of 2017 (the difference is 1848)
* According to the graph about the primary type of crimes in Chicago below, we can see that in general, the main types of crime remain stable in 2017 and 2018. There is no sharp decrease or increase in any type of crime on this graph with a scale of 100000 in count. Theft is the crime type with the most frequency in both years. Then comes the battery.

But in other 4 community areas, those two indicators are increasing in 2018. Community area 8 has the sharpest increase.
